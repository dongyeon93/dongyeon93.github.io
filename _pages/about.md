I'm a research associate (postdoctoral researcher) at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) working with Prof. [Rafal Mantiuk](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rkm38/). I received my Ph.D. degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en) from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html) as a member of [Optical Engineering and Quantam Electronics Lab](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/), formerly led by Prof. [Byoungho Lee](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROF). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University.

During my Ph.D., I primarily worked on improving the perceptual quality of next-generation 3D/4D displays. In my postdoctoral stage, I'm working on building visual perception models and quality metrics for next-generation displays (AR/3D/4D) to bridge the gap between machine perception and human visual perception. I'm broadly interested in AR/VR, computational optics, computational 3D displays, visual perception, and computer graphics.
