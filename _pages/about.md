I'm an incoming research associate (postdoctoral researcher) at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) working with Prof. [Rafal Mantiuk](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rkm38/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University as a member of [Optical Engineering and Quantam Electronics Lab](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/), formerly led by Prof. [Byoungho Lee](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROF). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University](http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en).

My research lies at the intersection of augmented/virtual reality, computational 3D displays, visual perception and computer graphics.
